      <p>
        I grew up in a small midwestern town near the Great Lakes and spent my
        childhood tinkering with everything I could get my hands on. I scavenged
        scrap from more than one neighbor's house renovation project to build
        tree-houses. I collected K'nex, Legos, and Erector Sets like they were
        going out of style. I learned to play bass guitar and worked with some
        friends to create several bands and write a ton of our own songs.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the age of ten, my dad taught me how to weld. We would spend our
        weekends building and modifying go-karts, homemade bicycle cars, and
        even an electric snowplow cart.

        I've always loved making things.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        I worked my way through various industries in my professional life,
        searching for something to help me fill that drive to create things. I
        worked in manufacturing machining parts for heavy-duty trucks. I worked
        in a temperature-controlled factory making food on a massive scale (Have
        you ever seen 12,000 lbs of chopped cabbage in one place?).
      </p>
      <p>
        My adventures with technology seriously began with a business venture
        designing and creating guitar effects pedals. I taught myself PCB
        design, screenprinting, metalworking, graphic design, and core
        electrical engineering concepts. I started my own website and filled
        custom orders that came in from the store and internet forums.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then I found a passion for helping people. I relocated to begin working
        in a call center, assisting musicians with the equipment they purchased.
        I worked with some of the biggest creators in the world (Sesame
        Workshop, WWE, The Learning Company). All the while, my interest in
        software grew. I helped create the first internal knowledge base for our
        technicians to support the 60,000 products we had in our catalog more
        efficiently.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then I moved into an IT role filling the knowledge gaps for a small team
        of developers. I helped provide end-user support, wrote documentation,
        researched web tools to help improve our processes, created how-to
        videos and helped vendors integrate into our automated invoicing
        systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Software engineering was something I had an interest in from my first
        high school technology class. We built simple landing pages using Adobe
        Dreamweaver and Apple iWeb (Remember that?!). I was encouraged by
        several colleagues to go back to school and earn a degree in software
        development and ultimately completed my B.S. in Web Design & Development
        from Full Sail University. Throughout my time in school, I continued
        working in my IT role. I even began assisting with software projects as
        my skills progressed. For the last 6 or so months of my program, I
        worked as a software engineer nearly full-time, creating applications to
        improve our employee onboarding and training experiences.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Hobbies</h2>
      <p>
        In addition to my interest and work with software, I also have a passion
        for music, smart home / IoT technology, home renovation, video gaming,
        enterprise computing, and cloud technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        I still play bass and have a cover band that plays Pop Punk songs from
        the early 2000s. I created and managed the band and (before covid) were
        playing gigs nearly every weekend. I designed our equipment rack to
        provide us with backing tracks for instruments we could not play
        ourselves, mix our audio for a PA system, and provide personalized audio
        mixes in our in-ear monitors.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am constantly improving my smart home setup and love trying out new
        products to help make controlling devices in my home as seamless as
        possible. I believe that a well-designed smart home should never feel
        complicated or require any particular actions to do basic things like
        turning on the lights.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also built my own homelab and have set up both a high-availability
        hardware cluster and a Kubernetes cluster to run many of the services
        that keep my smart home and personal projects working. I even installed
        my own homerun low-voltage wiring system to connect the various rooms in
        my house back to the lab.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the services I have running that my wife and I get a ton of use
        out of is our Minecraft servers. We love playing modded Minecraft and
        building complex automation systems to improve our gameplay.

      <p>
        I met my wife in middle school when our 6th-grade homerooms were
        adjacent to each other. We reconnected several years after school and
        have been together ever since. We got married shortly after moving to a
        new state for a new job.
      </p>
      <p>
        More recently, we bought our first house and scrambled to complete a
        nursery renovation before our first son was born.
